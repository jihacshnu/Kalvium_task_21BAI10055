PDF Co-Viewer is a web app that allows users to upload a PDF from their computer, share it with others via a unique link, and synchronize the page changes in real-time. The admin (the person who uploads the PDF) can change pages, and all users viewing the PDF via the shared link will automatically see the page changes.
